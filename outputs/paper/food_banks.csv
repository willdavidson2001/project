Ridership dropped to 26% of pre-COVID experience after the stay at home order, and remained near these levels throughout April and May of 2021.  As parts of the Province, including Toronto, entered step 1 of the Provinces reopening plan on June 8th, 2021, ridership increased to 33% of pre-COVID experience by the end of Q2 2021. The TTC will continue to monitor trends throughout 2021 and onward, to see how ridership recovers, as the pandemic measures and restrictions are lifted."
